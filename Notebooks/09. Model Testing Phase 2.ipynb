    "This notebook documents Phase 2 of model training for mental health text classification. The classifier is optimized on balanced training data to distinguish suicidal, depressive, anxious, and normal posts. For rigorous evaluation, the model is tested on a newly built test set—created by combining previously mentioned datasets—to ensure results reflect generalization across diverse text sources.\r\n"
